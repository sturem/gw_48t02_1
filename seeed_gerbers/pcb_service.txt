Expected file extensions are:
 .G[BT][LMO]:
   .G   - Gerber
    BT  - (Bottom|Top)
    LMO - (copperLayer|solderMask|silkscreenOverlay)
 .DRL - Drill file in Excellon format
 .GML - Gerber Milling Layer (or .GKO board Outline)

Seeed does not support Gerber 'X2" Enhanced/Advanced format.

Usually 8 files for a 2-layer board.
For 3-layer add .GL2 for copper inner layer 2, for
4-layer also add .GL3 (the numbering is a bit off?)

V-cuts to panelise boards must be horizontal or vertical,
across the whole board, and annotated in the GKO/GML file,
with a 4mm clearance to any circuitry on the panel..
Is it useful to add an outline on the silkscreen layer?

Seeed always needs bottom and top silk-screen overlays, e.g.:
 * 48T02_battery_replacement.GBO
 * 48T02_battery_replacement.GTO
They are negative image, so if no overlays are required,
then supply files with same edges and solid fill.
